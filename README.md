Hello! This repository hosts the data that I used for my final project for Slavic 4510: Hacking Slavic Literature at The Ohio State University during the autumn 2024 semester. I collected this data from the tables of contents of 22 issues of the post-Soviet feminist literary journal Вы и мы: Диалог женщин. This data, originally in separate tabs in a spreadsheet, has been separated into and uploaded as .tsv files for ease of access.
- "Raw data" includes all of the data exactly as I found it.
- "Cleaned data" includes all of the data, trimmed and consolidated into a spreadsheet that provides a base for further analysis.
- "Bimodal issue/author" includes the names of each article's author(s) next to the issue they appeared in.
- Similarly, "Nodes" and "Edges" contain author and issue information, but in a format that plays well with Gephi.
- "Communities Edges" and "Communities Nodes" contain roughly the same information as "Nodes" and "Edges", except each author's name only appears once per issue they were featured in.
- "Distinct authors per issue" contains the amount of distinct authors that appeared in each issue.
- "Subcategories" contains the amount of articles in a subcategory in each issue.
- "Author name appearances" contains the amount of times each author appeared in any issue.
